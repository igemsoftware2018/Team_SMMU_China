Although the calcium leakage plays a notable role in the development of Heart Failure (HF), it is hard to detect with noninvasive methods 
in clinical practice. The severity of HF can also be estimated by the level of calcium leakage, which in turn helps the clinical investors 
to determine the dosage and methodology of AAV based gene therapy. Therefore, we invented a software which can adopt the BNP expression 
level in patients' blood to reckon the level of calcium leakage, to choose of different AAVs and the to discriminate of expressing 
promoters.
